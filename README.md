## Introduction
A project for creating a web page dedicated to J K Rowling

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the project is to create  a blog page titled JK Rowling Fan Page dedicated to JK Rowling.  The web pages are designed by a fan to honour writer J K Rowling, the author of Harry Potter books.
This website is suitable for fans as  well as for people looking for more information on J K Rowling and Harry Potter.
The blog also has a section for the creaters point of view on how they enjoyed reading Harry Potter books. Furthermore, the website has a section dedicated to selling artifacts where a user would be able to select and customise and get a copy on mail.

## Sample
A sample of the main page is given below
